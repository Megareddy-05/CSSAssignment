    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion. </p>
    
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your
        choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is
        repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if 
        you didn't, it isn't.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that
        the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its
        children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice,
        and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try
        another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>This needs an example.</p><br>
    <img src="./Image_root.png">
    <ol start="1">
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li><br>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li><br>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li><br>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li><br>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li><br>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li><br>
    </ol>
    <pre style="background-color: grey; border-radius: 2px; border: 2px;">
    In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't
    have a data structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)

    <h1>The backtracking algorithm.</h1>
    <pre style="color: blue; border: 2px;">
     boolean solve(Node n)
    {
        if n is a leaf node
        {
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            else return false
        }else
        {
            for each child c of n
            {
                if solve(c) succeeds, return true
            }
            return false
        }
    }
    </pre> 
    <br>
    <pre style="background-color: grey; border-radius: 2px; border: 2px;">
    Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If solve(n)
    is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node.
    We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
    </pre>
    <br>
    <p><b>How does this work?</b></p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any
        child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this is done by the lines
    </p>
    <br>
    <pre style="color: blue; border: 200px; height: 100px; width: 100px; border-radius: 2px;">
    for each child c of n 
    {
        if solve(c) succeeds, return true
    }
    return false
    </pre>
    <br>
    <p>Eventually the recursion will "button" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf nodes is not
        a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by the lines/p><br>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        if n is a leaf node{
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            else return false
        }
        </pre><br>
        <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:</p><br>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>To search a tree</b></li>
        </ul>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
        </ol><br>
        <p><b>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</b></p><br>
        <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In
            fact, that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.
        </p><br>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        boolean solve(Node n) 
        {
            put node n on the stack;
            while the stack is not empty
            {
                if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf
                {
                    if it is a goal node, return true
                     else pop it off the stack
                }
                else
                {
                    if the node at the top of the stack has intried children
                       push the next untried child onto the stack
                      else pop the node off the stack 
                }
                return false
            }
        }
        </pre>
        <p>When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the node on the stack from a path from the root to a goal node.</p><br>
        <p>Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied in the sequence of recursive calls. Thus
            as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by printing the node at the current level, or storing it in a array.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print the nodes along the successful path:</p><br>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        boolean solve(Node n){
            if n is a leaf node{
                print n 
                return true
            }
            else return false
        }else{
            for each child c of n{
                if solve(c) succeeds{
                    print n 
                    return true
                }
            }
            return false
        }
        </pre><br>
        <h1>Keeping backtracking simple</h1><br>
        <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty
            cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex
        </p>
        <p>for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate
            solutions
        </p>
        <p>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could tests
            whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b>gameOver method</b>(or you could even call it <b>isLeaf).</b>This method would encapsulate
            all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.
        </p>
        <p>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children. If there is 
            an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next.
        </p>
        <p>For example, you might be able to number the <b>children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you 
        have just tried ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next.</p><br>
        <p> For example, you might be able to number the <b>children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have
        just tried <b>child k,</b> you know that you have already tried children 1 through <b>k-1,</b> and you have not yet tried children 
        <b>k+1</b> through <b>n.</b> Or, if you are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try <b>red first, then yellow, 
        then green, then blue.</b> If child yellow falls, you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices
        in the order left, straight, right <b>(or perhaps north, east, south, west).</b>
        </p><br>
        <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3><br>
        <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the
           simplest kind of tree, a binary tree. 
        </p>
        <p>A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference zero, one,
            or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes
            are reachable from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary
            tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which
            we repeat here) shows a binary tree.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class: </p><br>
        <pre style="border: 10px; color: blue;">
        public class BinaryTree{
            BinaryTree leftchild = null;
            BinaryTree rightchild = null;
            boolean isGoalNode = false;
            String name;

            BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode){
                this.name = name;
                leftchild = left;
                rightchild = right;
                this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
            }
        }
        </pre><br>
        <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree.</p>
        <br>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        static BinaryTree makeTree(){
            BinaryTree root,a,b,c,d,e,f;
            c= new BinaryTree("c", null, null, false);
            d= new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false);
            e= new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true);
            f= new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false);
            a= new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
            b= new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false);
            root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false);
            return root;
        }
        </pre><br>
        <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p><br>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        public static void main(String args[]){
            BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
            System.out.println(solvable(tree));
        }
        </pre><br>
        <p>And finally, here's the recrusive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p><br>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){ <br>
            /* 1 */ if (node == null) return false;<br>
            /* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;<br>
            /* 3 */ if (solvable(node.leftchild)) return true;<br>
            /* 4 */ if (solvable(node.rightchild)) return true;<br>
            /* 5 */ return false;<br>
            }
        </pre><br>
        <p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p><br>
        <ol type start="1">
            <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable.</li><br>
            <li>If the nodes we are given is a goal node, return success.</li><br>
            <li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable.</li><br>
            <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li><br>
            <li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.</li><br>
        </ol><br>
        <p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.</p><br>
        <p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable.
           An alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternative version:
        </p><br>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){<br>
            if (node.isGoalNode) return true;<br>
            if (node.leftchild ! = null && solvable(node.leftchild)) return true;<br>
            if (node.rightchild ! = null && solvable(node.rightchild)) return true;<br>
            return false;<br>
            }
        </pre><br>
        <p>I think the first version is simple, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p><br>
        <hr>
        <h3>What are the children?</h3><br>
        <p>one of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous
            choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the 
            right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without recursion.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are 
            colored.
        </p><br>
        <p>There are two ways to do this:</p><br>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li><br>
            <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of 
                countries, you have successfully colored the map.
            </li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a 
            checkerboard only needs two colors.
        </p><br>
        <h4><b>boolean mapIsOK()</b></h4>
        <p>Used by method 1 to check whether the entire map is colored correctly.</p><br>
        <h4><b>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</b></h4>
        <p>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.</p><br>
        <h4><b>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</b></h4>
        <p>Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard).</p><br>
        <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p><br>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color){
            if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return mapIsOK();
            map[row][column] = color;
            for (int nextcolor = RED; nextcolor <= BLUE; nextcolor++){
                int[]next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
                if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextcolor)) return true;    
            }
            return false;
        }
        </pre><br>
        <p>And here's the code for method 2:</p><br>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color){
            if(row >= NUM_ROWS)return true;
            if(okToColor(row, column, color)){
                map[row][column] = color;
                for (int nextcolor = RED; nextcolor <= BLUE; nextcolor++){
                    int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
                    if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextcolor)) return true;
                }
            }
            return false;
        }
        </pre><br>
        <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timings information suggests otherwise:</p>
        <br>
        <table border="2px" width="500px" height="70px" align="center">
            <thead>
                <tr>

                    <th style="background-color: #858585;">3 by 4 map</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th style="background-color: #858585;">Method 1:</th>
                    <td>60 ms.</td>
                    <td>940 ms.</td>
                    <td>60530 ms. (1 minute)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th style="background-color: #858585;">Method 2:</th>
                    <td>0 ms.</td>
                    <td>0 ms.</td>
                    <td>0 ms.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table><br>
        <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of
            these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will
            often prevent exponential growth.

        <h3><b>Debugging techniques</b></h3><br>
        <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall Back
            on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be applied
            to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.
        </p><br>
        <h4><b>Trick #1: Incident when you print method entries and exits.</b></h4><br>
        <p>Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return. You probably want to print, for each method, what parameters
           it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long list of these, it's hard to match up method exists
           with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.
        </p>
        <h4><b>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</b></h4><br>
        <p>Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or
            can affect the results, so be very with it.
        </p><br>
        <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs
           the proportions will be better.

        <h4><b>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</b></h4><br>
        <p>Writing debugging statements is programming,too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug
            the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?
        </p><br>
        <p>The simple solution is to make your debugging statement conditional. For example,</p><br>
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        static final boolean debugging = false;

        static void enter(BinaryTree node){
            if (debugging){

        <h4><b>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</b></h4><br>
        <p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message 
            printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions. </p><br>

            print statement.

            of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line 2n+1 dpaces to put the marbles in. start with the
            black marbles all at the one end, the white marbles all at the other end, and a free space in between.

    <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and return a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, which
        in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.
    </p>
    <p>Now to the program. The main program will intialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the 
        puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succedd and print out a winning path, or it will fail and the main program will have to
        print out bad news.
    </p>
    <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and return a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, which
        in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.</p>
    <p><b>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each
        space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board,int position)
        which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:
    </b></p>    <br>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right; </li>
        <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>Along with <b>canMove and makemove,</b> we are using methods <b>puzzleSolved and PrintBoard</b> with meanings that should be obvious.
    </p><br>
    <pre style="color: blue;">
        boolean solvable(int[] board){}
            if(puzzleSolved(board)){
                return true;
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <p>Along with canMoveand makeMove, we re using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with meanings that should be obvious.</p><br>
    <p>Here is some output from the program:</p><br>
    <ol type="1" reversed>
        <li><strong>WHITE WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK BLACK BLACK</strong></li>
        <li><strong>WHITE WHITE WHITE BLACK _____  BLACK BLACK</strong></li>
        <li><strong>WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</strong></li>
        <li><strong>WHITE WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK BLACK BLACK</strong></li>
        <li><strong>WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK BLACK</strong></li>
        <li><strong>WHITE WHITE WHITE BLACK BLACK WHITE _____</strong></li>
        <li><strong>_____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK BLACK</strong></li>
        <li><strong>WHITE WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK BLACK BLACK</strong></li>
        <li><strong>WHITE WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK</strong></li>
        <li><strong>WHITE BLACK WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK BLACK</strong></li>
        <li><strong>BLACK WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK</strong></li>
        <li><strong>WHITE WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK BLACK BLACK</strong></li>
        <li><strong>BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK</strong></li>
        <li><strong>WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____</strong></li>
        <li><strong>WHITE WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK BLACK BLACK</strong></li>
        <li><strong>_____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK</strong></li>
    </ol><br>
    <pre style="background-color: grey;" border-radius: 2px; border: 2px;>
    Notice that the solutions is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last line. I've
    added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its results in reverse order; 
    it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get them in the correct order.
